### ZSMBuild Minecraft Pack

This is the repository for files and updates to the ZSMBuild Minecraft Pack which is used on the ZSMB Minecraft server. 

### Intent of Pack
The intent of this pack is to create an experience where the user can focus on creating large towns or cities, with minimal annoyance from mobs.   Nonetheless, it is **designed to be played in survival mode** (you need to source and craft the items you use to build)

This modpack is currently based on Minecraft 1.14.4, as its the latest Minecraft with  access to a decent version of OptiFine (for users with limited RAM, or for users with beat machines who want shaders enabled)

### How to install/use
1. You need an existing Minecraft profile installed.  You can do this via installing the Minecraft Launcher, or use something like ATLauncher. ** Nonetheless, it must be installed **
1. Download the latest zip file [from our release page](https://github.com/tylergale/ZSMBuild/releases)
1. Launch the *forge-1.14.4-28.1.116-installer.jar* file, and install the *Client version* (it should auto detect where your Minecraft profile is).
1. Once the installation is finished, open the folder where it is installed, **and copy across the mods and shaderpacks folder from this repo.**
1. Make sure your Minecraft has been **configured to at least have 4GB of RAM** to play with!
